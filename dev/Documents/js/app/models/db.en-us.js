With huge tanks filled with Argon, a noble gas similar to nitrogen, and other cooled gases, the laboratory enhances scientific research production and generates and disseminates new knowledge to the mining chain."

Some research projects are in search, for example, for particles of dark matter left over from the Big Bang, the great explosion that gave rise to the Universe. Abundant in the Cosmos, neutrino is one of these particles. Electric charge-free and with an extremely small mass, it is considered a key element, because it can relate both with matter and dark matter."
